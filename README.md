*DESCRIPTION:

Java File Handling Example Programs

This repository contains a collection of Java programs that demonstrate essential file handling techniques. The primary aim of these programs is to help developers understand how to perform fundamental file operations efficiently while maintaining clear and well-structured code.

Features

File Handling Utility:

User-Friendly Interface: Allows users to choose operations from a simple menu.

Write to File: Captures user input and saves it to a specified file.

Read from File: Displays the content of the file on the console.

Modify File: Enables updating the existing content seamlessly.

Exit: Closes the program gracefully.

File Operations Demo:

File Creation: Generates a file and writes initial content to it.

Appending Data: Adds new lines without deleting the existing content.

Reading Data: Retrieves and displays the file content after every modification.

Deleting the File: Ensures cleanup after the demo completes.

Real-Time Logging: Displays clear status messages during each step.

Running the Programs

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/username/java-file-handling.git
cd java-file-handling

Compile the Java files:

javac FileHandlingUtility.java
javac FileOperationsDemo.java

Execute the programs:

java FileHandlingUtility
java FileOperationsDemo

Example Output

The utility program prompts the user to enter content and then displays the saved data upon reading.

The demo program shows how new lines can be appended, followed by reading and displaying the updated content. Finally, it cleans up by deleting the file.

Technologies and Concepts

Java 17

Command Line Operations

File I/O (BufferedWriter, FileReader, BufferedReader)

Error Handling for secure file manipulation

Applications

Simple Log Management: Maintain and view logs in a structured way.

User Input Storage: Save user-generated text for future reference.

Data Maintenance: Create, update, and delete data files efficiently.

Contributions

Feel free to contribute by forking the repository and adding more file handling methods or improving the existing code. Contributions are always welcome!
